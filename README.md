Text Analytics: 20 Newsgroups Dataset
----------------

Analysis of 20 Newsgroups Dataset Using Various Classification Models.

The goal of the project is to train different classifier and test the outcomes trying to achieve better accuracies. The appropriate classification algorithm with the optimal parameters will be selected to get best results. 

Refer to "User Instruction File.pdf" for brief instructions on how to set up and execute the python notebook.

• The 20 Newsgroup data is the collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, divided into 20 different newsgroups.
 
• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis followed by Data Cleaning which included, outlier treatment, corpus cleaning, removal of non-ascii characters, removal of stop words, stemming and lemmatization, generating unigrams and bigrams.

• Feature engineering techniques like TF-IDF Vectorizer and Count Vectorizer were used for tokenization in order to make the data ready for fitting the model.

• Developed a Logistic Regression model without stemming and L2 regularization which performed with 86% accuracy to automatically categorize 20K messages from 20 Newsgroup datasets
